### Julia Boop
Source Code and Schematics for making the 'Booper' - A primitive Raspberry Pi Pico Project.

The current version of the project presents 18 Programmable LEDS which are linked directly to the GPIO pins (Oops!)

Revision 2 Plans:

1. Use GPIO pins as a driver circuit to control transistors to control each LED.
2. PWM support
3. Create a PCB layout in EAGLE
4. Push Button to change the current pattern on demand
5. Software 'engine' to execute complex patterns
6. Restistor to control overall system brightness

# Ok, but why?

This is a very silly gift for christmas/valentines day.
