### The Booper (5000 Deluxe Edition)
Source Code and Schematics for making 'The Booper' - A primitive Raspberry Pi Pico Project.

The current version of the project presents 18 Programmable LEDS (In the shape of a heart) which are linked directly to the GPIO pins (Oops!)

Revision 2 Plans:

1. Wire Each Pin to a control a transistor which drives the LED
2. PWM support
3. Create a PCB layout in EAGLE
4. Push Button to change the current pattern on demand
5. Software 'engine' to execute complex patterns
6. Utalize CircuitPython
7. Restistor to control overall system brightness
8. Full BOM
9. Full PDF Explaining the Process

# Ok, but why?

This is a very silly gift for christmas/valentines day.
It is also useful to teach hardware coding
